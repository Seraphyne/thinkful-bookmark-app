- [x] Bookmarks contain:
  - [x] Title, URL link, Description, Rating (1-5 stars).

- [x] All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating. I can click on a bookmark to display the full detailed view.
- [x] Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link. Also, I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.
- [x] Receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
- [x] Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required). I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.
